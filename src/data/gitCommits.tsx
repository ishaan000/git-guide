          Imagine you&apos;re working on a project with a team. You come across
          a commit that says &quot;fix bug&quot; or &quot;update code&quot;. How
          helpful is that? Not very! Good commit messages are like a time
          machine - they help you and your team understand what changed and why.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          In this guide, you&apos;ll learn how to write commit messages that:
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>Make your code history clear and searchable</li>
          <li>Help your team understand changes quickly</li>
          <li>Make debugging easier</li>
          <li>Create a professional development history</li>

        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          A great commit message has a clear structure. Think of it like a good
          email - it has a subject line and a body. Let&apos;s break it down:
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <strong>Subject Line (First Line):</strong>
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep it under 50 characters</li>
          <li>Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, etc.)</li>
          <li>Don&apos;t end with a period</li>
          <li>
            Use imperative mood (&quot;Add feature&quot; not &quot;Added
            feature&quot;)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <strong>Body:</strong>
        </Typography>
        <ul>
          <li>Separate from subject with blank line</li>
          <li>Wrap at 72 characters</li>
          <li>Explain the WHY, not just the WHAT</li>
          <li>Include any breaking changes or deprecations</li>
        </ul>

          <li>feat: New feature</li>
          <li>fix: Bug fix</li>
          <li>docs: Documentation changes</li>
          <li>style: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)</li>
          <li>refactor: Code changes that neither fix bugs nor add features</li>
          <li>test: Adding or modifying tests</li>

          <li>Use blank lines between paragraphs</li>
          <li>First paragraph: What and why</li>
          <li>Subsequent paragraphs: Additional context</li>
        </ul>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
          <strong>2. Bullet Points:</strong>
        </Typography>
